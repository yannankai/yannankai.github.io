This work is a 3D RPG game inspired by the film 'A Touch of Zen.' In the game, players take on the role of the female protagonist, Yang Zhiyun, as they embark on a quest to find a treasure called the 'Golden Thread Crown' within the city of Baoyou. Players progress through the storyline by following clues and achieving the ultimate ending through puzzles, mini-games, and various interactive elements.

In "A Touch of Zen 2," I primarily hold the positions of game design and development. My responsibilities include:

1. Designing the game's world, mission structures, interaction logic, and all the associated game elements.
2. Managing the testing of the game for any bugs and implementing the save functionality.
