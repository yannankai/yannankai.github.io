This pedometer app, based on business simulation games, is developed using Xamarin and includes five pages: a home page, a running interface, a personal center, a calendar check-in, and interactive interfaces. By implementing interactions between a pet parrot and the user, it motivates users to develop a healthy habit of regular running.

In the front-end, Xamarin.Forms is used to implement various user interaction controls, which pass parameters received from the front-end to the back-end for data processing.

In the back-end, each parameter that the front-end reacts to is processed and results in changes to the user's local, personalized file. Simultaneously, the system utilizes an accelerometer sensor to implement step counting functionality, which is reflected in real-time on the front-end.

In this project, I primarily took on the responsibilities of **front-end development**. With the assistance of hot reloading, I worked on implementing the project's front-end pages.
